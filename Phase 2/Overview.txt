# Phase 2 Overview: Extended Neuroevolution Experiments

This phase of the project contains refined implementations and additional experimental conditions for the neuroevolution-based foraging simulation.

## Core Files:
- `emergentai copy.py` and `emergentai copy 2.py`: 
  Iterations of the core AI logic, including neural network architectures and evolution mechanisms. These variants explore different network configurations and learning parameters.

- `headlessv2.py`:
  Optimized headless simulation runner for batch experiments. Designed for running large-scale evolution trials without visual output.

- `headless_simulation_core.py`:
  Core simulation logic separated from visualization components. Contains the fundamental mechanics of the foraging environment.

- `experiment_runner.py`:
  High-level experiment orchestration script. Manages multiple trial runs with different parameters and collects results.

- `compare_values.py`:
  Analysis utility for comparing results across different experimental conditions. Generates comparative visualizations.

## Results Directory:
Contains CSV files for different experimental conditions:
- `baseline.csv`: Control scenario results
- `higher_mutation.csv`: Results with increased mutation rates
- `more_neurons.csv`: Results with expanded neural network architectures
- `no_assistance.csv`: Results without cooperative behaviors
- `no_auto_flee.csv`: Results with disabled automatic fleeing behavior

## Plots Directory:
Generated visualizations comparing different experimental conditions:
- `avg_fitness_comparison.png`: Comparison of average fitness across conditions
- `best_fitness_comparison.png`: Comparison of best-performing individuals
- `creatures_remaining_comparison.png`: Survival rate analysis
- `total_apples_deposited_comparison.png`: Resource collection efficiency comparison

## Key Experimental Variables:
- Neural network architecture variations
- Mutation rate modifications
- Presence/absence of cooperative behaviors
- Automatic survival mechanisms (fleeing)

## Running Experiments:
1. Use `experiment_runner.py` for full experimental suites
2. Use `headlessv2.py` for individual trial runs
3. Use `compare_values.py` to analyze and visualize results

Each experimental condition tests specific hypotheses about the emergence of cooperative behavior and survival strategies in the simulated environment.
Slight changes have been made to the code to support these experiments, as indicated in the comments within the code files.
Also based on the results, further refinements can be made for future phases.
